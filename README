WARNING: this library is in an extremely inmature
state. do not use in production (yet).

## ---- RATIONALE ----
php type system is not very advanced. Sometimes it is
cumbersome to check for ranges of values or fields in arrays
or objects. This library tries to alleviate this problem.

This library can be seen as a fake type system on top of
php.  It can also be regarded as a way to specify contracts on
types.

The values are checked at runtime.

The library Defines two functions: _pre, _post
Any error will break execution with the
file and line information where the constrain is not
fulfilled and a descriptive error.

## ---- USAGE ----

We define the types in a file types.php (see tests folder for examples)
For example we define a type Customer with the following
fields:

$a['Customer'] = array(
    'name' => ":string",
    'phone' => ":int"
);

In our code we include the phpcontract.php file

We use the _pre or _post functions to
stablish the constraint.

In the next example, the $data var is
constrained to the Customer definition.

<?php
require_once(dirname(__FILE__)."/../phpcontract.php");

function example($data) {
    _pre('Customer',$data);
}

//tests
//key literal
    $data_ok = array(
        'name' => "John"
    );
    $data_ko = array(
        'anme' => "John"
    );

example($data_ok);
?>

## ---- TODO ----
-more advanced contracts:
    -more advanced definitions:
        -ranges of values
        -optional fields
        -recusive definitions
        -object contraints:
            -inheritance
-logging instead of breaking as an option
-override _pre and _post function names
-more tests and examples
